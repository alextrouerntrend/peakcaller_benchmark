## Benchmarking Peakcallers For ATAC-Seq
---
#### Introduction
Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATAC-seq) data is analyzed by tools designed for predecessor genomic genrichment assays, such as the ubiquitous [ChIP-seq](1). Here I document the benchmarking of several of these tools within a standard ATAC-seq pipeline for differential peak analysis. The tools included in the benchmarking are as follows.
* MACS2
* Genrich
